# Iconpacks

Iconpacks change Discord's boring icons to something more fun and exciting.  
If you want to create your own iconpack, check out my [Themelings](https://github.com/nexpid/Themelings/tree/data) repo, which tracks Discord's icons and hosts them on GitHub. Just download the icons folder, modify the icons and you're done!
